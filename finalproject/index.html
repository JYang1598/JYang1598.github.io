    <p> 
                     
      <br> Hey there, my name is Jenna! I am currently a senior at the University of Wahsington- Bothell, and will be graduating this Spring 2021, with a bachelor of Arts: double majoring in Media and Communication Studies and Culture, Literature, and the Arts üë©üèª‚Äçüéì!  Throughout my four years at UWB, let's just say it's been a <strong> wild ride!üé¢!</strong> I have had the privilige of being a student leader at the ARC for two years now. While also building amazing mentor and mentee realtionships with my campus community, and working alongside some amazing institutions. I would like to think: "I know some stuff about college." <br>

        <br> The thought of college can sound quite daunting. But one thing to remeber, is that you are doing this to better your future- don't ever forget that! Some people say college is the best four years of thier lives, and for some it may not be-and that's very normal. Everyone has thier own adventure and story to tell. For me, I personally had an <strong>amazing</strong> four years despite the pandemic and the shift to Zoom University. <br> 
        No matter how many years it may take for you to finish, know that everyone has their own timeline. Do what works best for you. <br> 
        
       <br>  I hope that this web page, can be a helping hand in getting you through it all. </p>

         <br> The University of Washington-Bothell (UWB) was established in 1989. It is one of the three branch schools of the University of Washington. The University of Washington mascot is Dubs, the Alaskan Malamute. Thus, making studetns huskies, aka DaWgs. 

         Although farily new, UWB has made tremndous impacts, and is rapidly growing year after year.  
         
         
        Fun fact, UWB had a founding faculty of just 12! The campus held its first classes during Autumn 1990, and the first class to graduate was in 1991, and consisted of only 3 students! As of June 2021, this is the 30th commencement they have held. Fun fact, this is the largest UWB class to graduate- yet! * Proud to be part of the graduating class of 2021~!* <br> 

         <br>  The campus we see today isn‚Äôt exactly what we see today. It was actually home to the 500-acre purebred cattle Boone-Truly Ranch. The property was later sold in 1995 to the state of Washington. Fun fact, the Truly house is still around on campus today! Many teachers hold office hours there! It‚Äôs the cute little blue house near the surface parking lot. On a sunny day, you can see it peeking through the trees! <br> 
          
         <br>  The UWB campus is shared with Cascadia College and sits atop a 128-acre plot of picturesque land overlooking protected wetlands and Cascades beyond. UWB campus is quite modern and has stunning architecture and landscaping. The campus received the American Institute of Architects 2002 Honor Award for Washington Architecture! Its buildings were designed to complement the lands natural beauty. The campus is very environmentally friendly and are equipped with advanced technology for faculty and student use.

       The university of Washington-Bothell is home to more than 6,300 students, in which are enrolled in more than 55 different graduate and undergrad programs! 

        <br> In my personal opinion, what makes UWB such a great university to attend to is because it is a smaller campus, you have the opportunity of building more tight knit realtionships- whether that be friends and or your professors. Allowign you to create long lasting friendships. Another great benefit is that because the campus is smaller, you can get the neccary help you need when it comes to classes. As they can more easily provide and set time aside for you- in helping you to succeed. <br> 

        <br> During my undergrad, I am so glad and thankful to have had the amazing opportunity of building strong mentor and mentee relationships with my professors and campus community. It hoenstly makes your college journey more valuable and fun. <br>

     <br> <b>Registration days:</b>
        
        <br> Let me tell you, registration days are a pain. I am so excited that I can finally say I am done done with registering. 
        
        But have no fear, I am here to help give you some tips on how to prep! So, because UWB is on a tri quarter system, most students will register: end of spring quarter for Fall, then mid fall for Winter courses, then mid-winter for Spring courses and the cycle continues. <br>

       
        <h2 class="glow">Tip #1: Prep, Prep, Prep!‚è∞</h2>
        
       <br> Now, most wait until the day before registration, and or may even forget. But there are some students * I was one* who would prepare classes a couple of weeks before their registration day.  <br>
        
        <br> Around midterms week, you will see a little alter on your ‚ÄúMyUW‚Äù page, that will not only remind you when your registration date is, but it will also prompt you to update some things such as- whather you want to be able to vote in ASUWB elections, want a UPASS (Bus fee) etc. Doing this is vital ‚Äì I repeat vital! This is important, because if you don‚Äôt update this, you may find yourself having issues confirming your class on registration day- which basically means a student might take the spot you were intending on having for that class. <br> 
        
       <br>  I would also highly recommend you to reach out to professors who teach those classes if your comfortable doing so. Ask them anu questions you may have and or some clarifiactions. Or if that class is being taught by one of your previous professors, they can always give you more information. <br> 

       <h2 class="glow">Tip #2: Plan your classes strategically!‚ú®</h2>
        <br> If you work and are a full-time student like me, time management becomes crucial.  Think about what times you are clocked in to work at your job, and then find what classes work best for your schedule. Luckily for me, I worked on campus, so I was able to be in close proximity- allowing me to run from class to work. <br>

         At the beginning of every school year there is always an ARC carnival. Yes, I was one of those people that would drag my friends with me- and then we would have the time of our lives. Plus, you pay to college and all of these events are held for free since you already paid for tuition- so why not take advantage of these amazing and un opportunities!  One of my favorites was the Harry Potter themed party! <br>

        <b> How to get to Beardslee Building *FAST*</b>
        As a freshman, I had no idea of where Beardless was and or who to get there. If you have a beardless class it was be labled as UWBB. Luckily, I started class Monday, but didn‚Äôt have my class in the Beardslee class until the Tuesday. So, Luckily, I was able to practice before. 

        So on my first day I took the path that most sutdetns took. (map below) 

        <img src= "images/How most students get to Beardslee Building.PNG"> 
        Now, at first glance it seems like it is shorter and more easy ‚Ä¶right? Well actually in my personal opion, this felt and took the longest. 

        Taking this path, though yes it is more scnendic, but rmeemer you got a class you must be at. you end up running through many intersections with stop lights. Which makes you wait atleast 3 minutes. And remember, you only really have like 15 minutes, and this path takes atleast 10 minutes, which only gives you about 5 minutes to be in class. Beardlsee building can be a little confusing, so allow a little bit of time in case. <br> 

       <br>  Whereas, if you take the this path- the one I would recommend. You get to your class in less than 10 minutes. <br>

       <img src="images/How to get to Beardslee builing_the right way.PNG">

       <br> Because you walk through Husky Housing, you have little no traffic, no stop lights, and the path is quite flat, so you end up feeling less tired, and can speed walk more quickly. You only really run into 2 stop lights. Whereas, the second one you run into at least 3-4 stop lights. <br>

       <br> <b>Tip: </b>
        Honestly, never take the elevator unless if you really can‚Äôt make it. Elevators always take forever, and most students always want to take the elevarot- so it‚Äôs always busy. By the time you take the stairs, you would have already beat the classmates that you saw at the elevator. <br> 

        After the first week, you will soon fine your groove, and what works best for you!
